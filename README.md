# omnigraffle-aws-stencils
AWS stencils for use within OmniGraffle...

# Usage
I drop these into the OmniGraffle stencils directory, which for me is in:
```zsh
cd /Users/${USER}/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniGraffle7/Data/Library/Application\ Support/The\ Omni\ Group/OmniGraffle/Stencils/AWS
```

# Hat Tip
These stencils were created using [OmniGraffle-Stencil](https://github.com/m-radzikowski/omnigraffle-stencil).
